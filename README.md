# assisted_writing

I tried using a simple RNN for an assisted writing tool. It was fun building a user interface. 

It didn't work well. 

I would definitely use GPT-2, CTRL, GPT-3 or something crazy like that now. I actually wrote a whole essay using generated text several years later. 

I would love to write a novel using AI assisted writing tools.
